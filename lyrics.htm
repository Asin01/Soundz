               <h1>Lose Yourself</h1>
               <p>Look<br>
                If you had<br>
                One shot<br>
                Or one opportunity<br>
                To seize everything you ever wanted<br>
                In one moment<br>
                Would you capture it<br>
                Or just let it slip?<br>
                Yo<br>
                His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
                There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
                He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br>
                To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'<br>
                What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
                He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
                He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now<br>
                The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!<br>
                Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity<br>
                Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked<br>
                He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No<br>
                He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes<br>
                It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke<br>
                He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when its<br>
                Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody<br>
                Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
                You own it, you better never let it go<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
                You own it, you better never let it go<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
                You better<br>
                His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping<br>
                This world is mine for the taking<br>
                Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order<br>
                A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar<br>
                It only grows harder, only grows hotter<br>
                He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him<br>
                Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter<br>
                Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
                He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
                But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water<br>
                These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br>
                They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada<br>
                So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on<br>
                Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da<br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
                You own it, you better never let it go<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
                You own it, you better never let it go<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
                You better<br>
                No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>
                Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br>
                I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed<br>
                I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
                But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
                Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>
                All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
                Fact that I can't get by with my nine to<br>
                Five and I can't provide the right type of<br>
                Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br>
                And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer<br>
                This is my life and these times are so hard<br>
                And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus<br>
                Teeter-totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna<br>
                Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much<br>
                For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's<br>
                Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got<br>
                To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot<br>
                Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not<br>
                Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot<br>
                So here I go, is my shot<br>
                Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
                You own it, you better never let it go<br>
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
                You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>

                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
                You better<br>
                You can do anything you set your mind to, man<br>

                    There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'<br>
                    Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em<br>
                    But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?<br>
                    My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father<br>
                    If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?<br>
                    I'ma name her Bonnie<br>
                    I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry<br>
                    I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him<br>
                    I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan<br>
                    I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam<br>
                    I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man<br>
                    I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat<br>
                    Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,<br>
                    Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan<br>
                    This is Stan<br>
                    <br>
                    My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I<br>
                    Got out of bed at all<br>
                    The morning rain clouds up my window<br>
                    And I can't see at all<br>
                    And even if I could it'll all be gray<br>
                    Put your picture on my wall<br>
                    It reminds me, that it's not so bad<br>
                    It's not so bad<br>
                    <br>
                    Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance<br>
                    I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans<br>
                    If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert<br>
                    You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew<br>
                    That's my little brother man, he's only six years old<br>
                    We waited in the blistering cold for you<br>
                    For four hours and you just said, "No."<br>
                    That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol<br>
                    He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do<br>
                    I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to<br>
                    Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back<br>
                    See I'm just like you in a way<br>
                    I never knew my father neither<br>
                    He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her<br>
                    I can relate to what you're saying in your songs<br>
                    So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on<br>
                    'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed<br>
                    I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest<br>
                    Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds<br>
                    It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me<br>
                    See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it<br>
                    My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7<br>
                    But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does<br>
                    She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man<br>
                    I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose<br>
                    Sincerely yours, Stan<br>
                    P.S. we should be together too<br>
                    <br>
                    My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I<br>

                    Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"<br>
                    This will be the last package I ever send your ass<br>
                    It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?<br>
                    I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect<br>
                    So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it<br>
                    I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway<br>
                    Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka<br>
                    You dare me to drive?<br>
                    You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"<br>
                    About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning<br>
                    But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?<br>
                    That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning<br>
                    Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy<br>
                    And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call<br>
                    I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall<br>
                    I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it<br>
                    You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<br>
                    And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it<br>
                    I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me<br>
                    See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!<br>
                    Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk<br>
                    But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you<br>
                    'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too<br>
                    Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now<br>
                    Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?<br>
                    <br>
                    My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I<br>
                    Got out of bed at all<br>
                    The morning rain clouds up my window<br>
                    And I can't see at all<br>
                    And even if I could it'll all be gray<br>
                    Put your picture on my wall<br>
                    It reminds me, that it's not so bad<br>
                    It's not so bad<br>
                    <br>
                    Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy<br>
                    You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?<br>
                    Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that<br>
                    And here's an autograph for your brother<br>
                    I wrote it on the Starter cap<br>
                    I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you<br>
                    Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you<br>
                    But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?<br>
                    I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?<br>
                    You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling<br>
                    To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some<br>
                    And what's this shit about us meant to be together?<br>
                    That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other<br>
                    I really think you and your girlfriend need each other<br>
                    Or maybe you just need to treat her better<br>
                    I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<br>
                    Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine<br>
                    If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan<br>
                    Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan<br>
                    I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<br>
                    I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<br>
                    Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge<br>
                    And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid<br>
                    And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<br>
                    Come to think about, his name was, it was you<br>
                    Damn!<br>
                    <br>

                But my head was underwater<br>
                They called me weak<br>
                Like I'm not just somebody's daughter<br>
                Coulda been a nightmare<br>
                But it felt like they were right there<br>
                And it feels like yesterday was a year ago<br>
